# MMS
A non-redundant list of microduplication and microdeletion syndromes (MMS) was obtained from the following databases and publications: Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen; www.clinicalgenome.org) [13] via UCSC's Table Browser (iscaCuratedPathogenic; n= 61) [14, 15], DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER; https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/; n= 66) [16], Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM; www.omim.org) [17] via the Gene2Map file (keywords: contiguous gene, chromosome (exclude: open reading frame), deletion, duplication, triplication, and quadruplication; n=115), Nevado et al. [18] (n=99), Table 2 of Bentacur [19] (n=39), Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 of Kaminsky et al. [20] (n=41), Additional File 5 of Marcinkowska et al. [21] (n=20) and Table 1 of Wiese et al. [22] (n=193). The non-redundant list was curated to exclude disorders which were only described in a single patient (e.g. 3p11.2‚Äêp12.1 [12, 23]) or family and disorders which are not asssociated with congenital disease (e.g. 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome; OMIM 613523). CNV disorders were retained even if only the duplication or deletion has been observed or assoicated with human disease. When possible, coordinates for the CNV disorders were obtained from either DECIPHER or ClinGen (accessed August 2021). For all remaining MMS without consensus coordiantes, CNV coordinates for each reported patient were identified as were the coordiantes for any defined shortest region of overlaps (SRO) or minimal regions (Supplementary Table 4). All coordinates were converted from their initial assembly into hg19 coordinates using UCSC's Liftover Tool [24]. These patient and minimal regions were utilized to define the representative CNV interval and when applicable minimal region(s) of overlap. Some MMS were divided into multiple interval regions to account for: recurrent CNVs with multiple breakpoints (e.g. 15q11.2 BP1-2 vs 15q11.2 BP1-3 vs 15q11.2 BP2-3), size differences due to the presence of segmental duplications within a CNV call (1q21.1 TAR Susceptibility Locus), and to account for mutliple minimal CNV regions (e.g. 1q24-q25). Further details on the representative and minimal intervals for each CNV disorder can be found in (Supplementary File 2). BED file versions of Table 1 are available in hg19 (Supplementary Table 2) and GRCh38 (Supplementary Table 3) coordinates. Supplementary Table 1 is an expansion of Table 1 and includes the GRCh38 coordinates.
